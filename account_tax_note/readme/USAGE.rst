If you maintain taxes using tax templates, you can update the note in the tax
template. Otherwise you can update it directly in the tax.

Use the OCA module `account_chart_update <https://github.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/blob/11.0/account_chart_update/README.rst>`_
if you want to update the taxes based on the changes made to the templates.
